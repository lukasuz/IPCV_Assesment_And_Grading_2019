# Grading & Assessment

## Test Dates
??.?? - Multisensor Fusion and Navigation *unannounced*

24.10 - Numerical Analysis

24.10 - Multisensor Fusion and Navigation 1

05.11 - Parallel Computing Architectures 1

02.12 - Data Mining (09.12 Replacement)

05.12 - Multisensor Fusion and Navigation 2

10.12 - Parallel Computing Architectures 2


## Parallel Computing Architectures

- **Two tests** on Nov. 4th and Dec. 2th, if both tests are graded 4 or 5 a mark is offered
- Otherwise test on the end of semester (*?*)



## Basic Image Processing

- **Test every lecture** between Week 2 and 12, 2 short questions for maximum of 2 points (13.5/22 minimum needed). One test can be optionally "recovered" on Week 13
- **Weekly lab practice** (7/11 minimum needed) 
- **Four assignments** during semester (14/22 minimum needed)
- **Oral exam** at end of semester, if all the thresholds are passed
- Final mark consists of 30% midterm points (*Does that mean the tests, labs and assignments?*) and 70% of oral exam

**Offered Grade**:

```
Get a 5, if you have 90% in the tests (22/24), labs (10/11), and assignments (20/22).
```



## Biomedical Signal Processing

- **Assignment** give maximum of 50% of final mark (minimum 25% needed)
- **Test** on 13th of December gives other 50% (minimum 25% needed)

**Grading scale:**

```
   - 39%: 1
40 - 53%: 2
54 - 67%: 3
68 - 81%: 4
82 -   %: 5
```



## Numerical Analysis

- **Midterm test** on 24th of October
- **Four computer lab assignments** during semester

**Final grade:**

```
A := internal assment mark, made up of 50% from computer lab assignments and 50% from midterm test.
E := final exam

Final grade = max{E,(2E + A)/3}
```

**Grading scale:**

```
   - 50%: 1
51 - 60%: 2
61 - 74%: 3
75 - 85%: 4
86 -   %: 5
```



## Multimodal Sensor Fusion and Navigation

- Slides mention **Colloquium** at end of course (*how does that fit into the grading scale?*)
- **Tests**
  - Two announced tests, each 40%
  - Multiple unannounced five-minute tests, 20%
- Possible **end year task** can boost grade by 1 or 2.
- **Good lab work** can bring 1-5% extra, bad working can bring -5%.

**Grading scale:**

```
120% - 150%:  5
90% - 120%:   4
70-90%:       3
40-70%:       2
0%-40%:       1 (no signature)
```



## Design Patterns

- Short **test every lecture** (maximum of 3 can be missed), 30% of final mark
- Eight **homeworks**, 40% of final mark
- Oral **final exam**, 30% of final mark. Conditions are: attending at least 8 lectures, Submitting at least 7 homeworks, >50% average on both the homework and the written tests

**Grading scale:**

```
[0% 49%) : 1
[50% 65%) : 2
[66% 75%) : 3
[76% 85%) : 4
[86% 100%] : 5 
```



## Data Mining
- Short **test** every lab (50% minimum)
   - Attendance minimum 80%
- **Midterm test** (50% minimum)
- One **Assignment** (50% minimum)
- Final **oral exam**
- Final mark consists of 20% assignment, 20% midterm test, and 60% oral exam

**Grading scale:**
```
>= 50% satisfactory (2)
>= 63% average (3)
>= 75% good (4)
>= 87% excellent (5)
```
